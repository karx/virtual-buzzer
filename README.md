## The Snakes and Ladders Game proto

* [Virtual The Board](https://vb.akriya.co.in)
This page represents the shared board amongst the players. Opened on TV screen, laptop screems, alternate screen basically.

* [Virtual The Control](https://vb.akriya.co.in/watch)
The watch-ful Eye, the Controller, this will help roll a die, have all the controls, basically all the User interaction here. The gamepad. 

Hoping to make this page complaint and exposed as a gamepad if I get that good someday: https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-gamepads-module

Open as many as you want!... Well don't. Easy to play with Just 2-10 Players.

Roll the die to begin.
